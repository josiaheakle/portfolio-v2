It will be called\r\n whenever the state changes, with the new value of `inView`. In addition to the\r\n `inView` prop, children also receive a `ref` that should be set on the\r\n containing DOM element. This is the element that the IntersectionObserver will\r\n monitor.\r\n\n If you need it, you can also access the\r\n [`IntersectionObserverEntry`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserverEntry)\r\n on `entry`, giving you access to all the details about the current intersection\r\n state.\r\n\n ```jsx\r\n import { InView } from 'react-intersection-observer';\r\n\n const Component = () => (\r\n <InView>\r\n {({ inView, ref, entry }) => (\r\n      <div ref={ref}>\r\n        <h2>{`Header inside viewport ${inView}.`}</h2>\r\n      </div>\r\n    )}\r\n </InView>\r\n );\r\n\n export default Component;\r\n ```\r\n\n ## Plain children\r\n\n You can pass any element to the `<InView />`, and it will handle creating the\r\n wrapping DOM element. Add a handler to the `onChange` method, and control the\r\n state in your own component. Any extra props you add to `<InView>` will be\r\n passed to the HTML element, allowing you set the `className`, `style`, etc.\r\n\n ```jsx\r\n import { InView } from 'react-intersection-observer';\r\n\n const Component = () => (\r\n <InView as=\"div\" onChange={(inView, entry) => console.log('Inview:', inView)}>\r\n <h2>Plain children are always rendered.
